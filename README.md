I created this repository to hold my own document template for my master. It took a lot more effort than I thought was necessary, and Word itself wasn't helping much either. 

I accept pull request, and you can feel free to fork my repo.

The basic master template is based on the official guidelines from NTNU for how to format you master thesis.
