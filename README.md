# NTNU Document Templates
> Sharing the effort of being consistent

##WHAT
I created this repository to hold my own document template for my 
master thesis. It took a lot more effort than I thought was necessary, 
and Word itself wasn't helping much either. 

The basic master thesis template is based on [the official guidelines](https://innsida.ntnu.no/documents/10157/124399535/Formatting+your+master%27s+thesis+in+Microsoft+Word/03c81406-f69f-4caf-8cbd-cfe3bc9c6300) from 
NTNU for how to format you master thesis.

##INSTALL
For a normal Windows or Mac user just download, open in Word, and "Save as ... template".
For more technical users, see the contribute section for an automated way ;)

##CONTRIBUTE
I accept pull request, so feel free to fork my repo, and make changes.
Please add more templates (LaTex, Word, Excel) if you have some based 
on official guidelines.

### Checking out the code and installing the templates
```
git clone git@github.com:fatso83/ntnu-templates.git
